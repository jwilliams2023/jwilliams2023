# Joseph Williams

I'm a current Computer Science student at Auburn University, getting a minor in Statistics focusing on data science, and I expect to graduate in Fall 2025.
<br />

I'm working on expanding my skills in software engineering, data science, and AI/ML.
<br />

I've shared as many of my public projects as possible, and I’m always adding more as I continue developing my skillset through academic coursework and personal initiatives.

# About Me

From an early age, I always thought coding was a cool and fascinating thing. I remember spending time on various websites, using the "Inspect Element" tool to peek behind the scenes, wondering how everything worked. I would play around with editing or deleting code, amazed at how simple changes could affect the way a website looked or functioned. As a kid and even as a current adult, I would also watch countless YouTube videos, trying to learn more about what went on behind the scenes in coding and technology. This hands-on tinkering and curiosity fueled my passion for tech.

In high school, I took coding classes, and it became clear to me that coding was more than just a hobby—it was the profession I wanted to delve into. I knew then that pursuing a major in Computer Science was the path for me. My brother, who is also a Computer Science graduate and has a master's degree, has been a big inspiration and a mentor to me. He has guided me not just in the field but also in learning new tools and technologies, and his journey has motivated me to continue pursuing my passion.

This passion brought me to Auburn University, where I am working on my degree in Computer Science, along with a minor in Statistics focusing on data science. My academic journey has allowed me to explore a variety of fields like software development and machine learning. My love for coding and technology has only grown stronger as I’ve built projects and taken on challenges that combine problem-solving with data-driven insights.

Throughout my journey, I’ve gained experience with multiple programming languages, tools, and technologies, applying them to both personal projects and academic work. I’m always eager to learn more and advance my skills, and in the future, I hope to pursue a master’s degree to deepen my knowledge and expertise even further. With each new project, my desire to contribute to real-world technological advancements grows, and my goal is to use my skills to make meaningful contributions in the tech industry.
